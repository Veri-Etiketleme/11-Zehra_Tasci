# Expresso-Customer-Churn-Prediction
This repository explains how to predict customer churn. An Hackathon Organized by Data Science Nigeria(DSN-AI) to help Expresso predict customer Churn. <b>My 2nd place solution </b>, log_loss of 0.246675 on [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/hackathons/dsn-pre-bootcamp-hackathon-expresso-churn-prediction-challenge/leaderboard) where the competition was hosted. I've also added a section in the notebook to get a score of  0.246643, which could be the 'unofficial' <b> 1st place solution </b>.

### About [Expresso](http://www.expressotelecom.sn/):
