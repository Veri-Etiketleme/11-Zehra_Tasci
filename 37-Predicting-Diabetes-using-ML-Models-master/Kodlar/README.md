# Introduction
The rate of diabetic patients has been increasing in USA. In the next coming years, it is predicted that proportion of people suffering from diabetes can go up to one person in three by 2050 from one person in seven. In order to address this issue before it gets more sever, machine learning was used in this project to predict the diabetes. The goal of this project is to build significantly efficient models to predict diabetes of an individual so that depending on the prediction one can take care of the lifestyle and diet in a healthy way which would not cause diabetes. This study implements traditional classification models and evaluated using different evaluation matrices.
# Data Collection
The diabetes dataset is taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of 768 datapoints and 9 features. Outcome was the dependent variable. Zero indicates an outcome means no diabetes whereas one value of diabetes means diabetes. The nine features in dataset are as:  Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age, Outcome. 
# Methods Implemented
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. KNN
4. Random Forest
5. Gradient Boosting
# Conclusion
The feature Glucose was observed to be one of the most influential features towards diabetes as it had a high importance compared to the classification algorithms used in this project. 
The best model for this dataset is Gradient Boosting as it has high accuracy when compared to other classification model used in this project.
