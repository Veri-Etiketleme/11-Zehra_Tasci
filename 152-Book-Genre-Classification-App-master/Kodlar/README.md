# Book-Genre-Classification-App
This App predicts-classifies a genre of a book based on its summary using ML models, deployed with AWS.

# Project Flow:

1) Load the data into Dataframe

2) Perform Data preprocessing like handling missing values,feature creation, etc.

3) Perform Exploratory data analysis and get valuable information from the data.

4) Perform feature selection and select best algorithm which fits the data

5) Pickle the model and unpickle the model while integrating with the UI which is made using flask.

6) deploy the model on AWS EC2 instance. 

## Note - I am working on to add the Complete end-to-end description for this project. Please stay tuned!!
